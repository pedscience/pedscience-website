abstract: "
Background: Currently, to the best of our knowledge, no findings exist concerning the needs of professionals in specialized pediatric palliative care (PPC) regarding electronic health records (EHRs). Several studies have highlighted benefits concerning the use of EHRs in pediatrics. However, usability is strongly affected by the degree of adaptivity to the context of application. The aim of this study is to examine the needs of professionals concerning an EHR in the specialized PPC inpatient and outpatient settings. Methods: A qualitative research design was chosen to address the complex aspects of user demands. Focus group interviews and semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted with PPC professionals. _N_ = 23 participants from inpatient and _N_ = 11 participants from outpatient settings of specialized PPC representing various professions took part in the study. Results: The findings could be grouped into four categories: (1) attitude towards the current methods of documentation, (2) attitude towards electronic documentation in general, (3) general requirements for an EHR, and (4) content requirements for an EHR. Conclusions: Professionals in specialized PPC expect and experience many benefits of using electronic documentation. Their requirements for an EHR for inpatient and outpatient settings of PPC are largely consistent with EHRs for pediatrics. However, individual specifications and adaptations are necessary for this particular setting.
