abstract: "
Background: Electronic medical records (EMRs) play a key role in improving documentation and quality of care in paediatric palliative care (PPC). Inadequate EMR design can cause incorrect prescription and administration of medications. Due to the fact of complex diseases and the resulting high level of medical complexity, patients in PPC are vulnerable to medication errors. Consequently, involving users in the development process is important. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of a medication module from the perspective of potential users in PPC and to involve them in the development process. Methods: A qualitative observational study was conducted with 10 nurses and four physicians using a concurrent think-aloud protocol and semi-structured qualitative interviews. A qualitative content analysis was applied based on a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. Results: Requirements from the user’s perspective could be identified as possible influences on acceptance and actual use. Requirements were grouped into the categories “performance expectancies” and “effort expectancies”. Conclusions: The results serve as a basis for further development. Attention should be given to the reduction of display fragmentation, as it decreases cognitive load. Further approaches to evaluation should be taken.
