abstract: "
**Background:**
Paediatric palliative care (PPC) is a noncurative approach to the care of children and adolescents with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses. Electronic medical records (EMRs) play an important role in documenting such complex processes. Despite their benefits, they can introduce unintended consequences if future users are not involved in their development. 


**Aim:** 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of a novel module for nursing documentation by nurses working in the context of PPC. 


**Methods:** An observational study employing concurrent think-aloud and semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 nurses working in PPC. Based on the main determinants of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. 


**Results:** The main determinants of UTAUT were found to potentially influence acceptance of the novel module. Participants perceived the module to be self-explanatory and intuitive. Some adaptations, such as the reduction of fragmentation in the display, the optimization of confusing mouseover fields, and the use of familiar nursing terminology, are reasonable ways of increasing software adoption. 


**Conclusions:** After adaptation of the modules based on the results, further evaluation with the participation of future users is required.
