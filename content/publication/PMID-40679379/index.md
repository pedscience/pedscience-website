abstract: "
**Objectives:** Preliminary evidence suggests that children and adolescents with high-impact chronic primary pain benefit from intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment involving both patients and their caregivers. While it is important for patients and caregivers to be satisfied with the treatment, previous studies have not observed an association between treatment satisfaction and other treatment outcomes, such as pain symptoms. We hypothesized that the helping alliance—both between patients and health care professionals (HCPs) and between caregivers and HCPs—plays a role in treatment satisfaction. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the helping alliance in treatment satisfaction for pediatric chronic pain patients and their caregivers.


**Materials and Methods:** We computed 2 actor-partner interdependence models to analyze the dyadic associations between the predictor helping alliance and the outcome treatment satisfaction. Analyses were based on data from n = 205 patients, n = 191 caregivers, and n = 197 HCPs.


**Results:** Results revealed that patients’ and caregivers’ treatment satisfaction was positively associated with the quality of their respective helping alliance with their HCP. Notably, patients’ perceptions of their alliance with HCPs were positively associated with caregiver treatment satisfaction, and caregivers’ perceptions of their alliance with HCPs were linked to patients’ treatment satisfaction.


**Conclusions:** These findings highlight the importance of viewing pediatric pain patients, caregivers, and HCPs as an interdependent network. Future studies may extend our findings to other clinical settings and longitudinally.
