abstract: "
**Objectives:** In pediatric palliative care, effective communication is one of the most important skills. However, physicians often lack proper training. This study examines how to enhance medical students’ ability to deliver a life-limiting diagnosis to parents. For this, we evaluated the effectiveness of two educational videos..


**Methods:** We randomly assigned 114 medical students to two intervention groups and one control group. The intervention consisted of two different educational videos. We used self-assessment instruments and objective measures. Group-specific differences were analyzed using (repeated measures) Analysis of Variance, accounting for the effects of covariates, and t-tests.


**Results:** Analysis of self-assessed communication skills identified a positive effect of the ‘time x group’ interaction (F (2) = 3.25, p = 0.042, n<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>= 0.055), indicating a statistically significant increase in both intervention groups. A positive effect of both videos on performance was observed for one item.


**Conclusions:** An acting or animated video can have a small but significant impact on self-assessed communication skills and objectively assessed behaviour for medical students with varying levels of experience in delivering bad news to parents.


**Practice implications:**
Further research is required to investigate the long-term impact of educational videos on the communication behaviour of providers interacting with parents.
