abstract: "
Pediatric palliative care (PPC) patients require years of care across professions and sectors. Sharing treatment-related information and communicating among different PPC professionals is critical to ensure good quality of care. In Germany, this communication is mostly paper-based and prone to errors. Therefore, an electronic cross-facility health record (ECHR) was participatorily designed with users, wherein information can be shared and PPC professionals can communicate with each other. As this form of electronic health record differs from existing models in Germany, there is a need for successful implementation to ensure a positive impact. Therefore, the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of ECHR in PPC were examined. Using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR), transcripts of 32 interviews, 3 focus groups, and 20 think-aloud studies with PPC professionals were analyzed. CFIR indicated that the ECHR-design was viewed positively by users and can be a facilitator for implementation. Barriers exist, mainly due to the fact that the implementation is not planned, the use of the ECHR involves effort, costs are not covered, and all users must be motivated to use the ECHR for functionality. CFIR helps uncover the crux of the issues that need to be considered when planning ECHR implementation to improve care in PPC.
