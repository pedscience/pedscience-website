abstract: "
**Context:**
In pediatric palliative care, irritability of unknown origin (IUO) in children with severe neurological impairment is a peculiarly complex and challenging symptom, yet its etiology remains poorly understood.


**Objectives:**
Presenting a structured IUO diagnostic and therapeutic approach developed in a specialized inpatient pediatric palliative care facility for identifying IUO's potential contributing factors (PCFs).


**Methods:**
Prospective observational study with N = 22 children showing IUO at admission to the inpatient pediatric palliative care facility. Analysis of patient records and participation in ward routine to identify and treat PCFs. Treatment outcome was assessed using a standardized protocol for tracking IUO at 24-hour intervals.


**Results:**
Altogether, 136 PCFs were identified (average 6.18 per child) with pain and psycho-social problems being the most common. Two hundred and twenty-two diagnostic measures were initiated of which 159 (71.6%) helped identify a PCF. The majority of PCFs were identified by basic diagnostics (93.7%). Inpatient length of stay and duration of IUO phases correlated significantly. Between baseline (days 3â€“5; timing at which inpatients experientially show regular behavior) and discharge, patients showed a significant reduction in average 24-hours IUO duration by 1 hour and 26 minutes (Wilcoxon test: Z = -3.29, P < 0.01).


**Conclusion:**
Results lead to a more thorough understanding of PCFs to IUO. Following a systematic approach such as the one presented, PCFs can be detected even by simple diagnostics. In addition to biological aspects, diagnostics and therapy should address psycho-social aspects of IUO.
